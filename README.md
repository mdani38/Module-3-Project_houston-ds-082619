## Results 

### Effect of Genre (Pop/R&B vs Electronic)

Average score: 7.005

Rock makes up most of review population

3 of the top 4 most reviewed albums have lower averages than mean

Ran Welch's t -test for Electronic and Pop to determine statistical significance

Can reject null hypthesis

Electronic music was reviewed more favorably than Pop


### Label Significance

Threw out labels with less than 40 albums and self - released albums

Ran two tailed z test for each label against populations

Only 15 pass test and null hypothesis can be rejected

All of these 15 have higher means than the average score of population

Majority of labels  have rock albums but 3 have other focuses 


### Pitchfork Staff Vs. Freelance

Staff reviews are slightly more critical than freelance reviews. 

May be due to higher quality reviews for staff members 

### Length of Reviews
Longer reviews are more favorable than shorter reviews

Shorter reviews may be "troll" accounts
